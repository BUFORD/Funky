Destructibles and Interactables that are face-to-face with bot are causing the intersection test to continue to fail, resulting in no interaction.

LOS test for rechecks on UNITs should incorperate the ability being tested.
	-Projectiles should require AllowProjectile in navcheck
	-Ranged Locational abilities should check object intersection
	-These abilities should be tracked and rechecked against the unit in target validation.
