Add behavior to return to starting position of first combat.
This behavior will only trigger during behavior tags that require interaction of objects.
The behavior will return to the starting point after combat is finished.








Create a cache related to world objects seen.

Check for specific objects that may be cached.
Behavior: Return to nearest waypoint object.
Behavior: Return to dungeon entrances.

Add a cache for dungeon IDs that have multiple levels.
Add a cache for dungeon IDs that are single level but are randomized worlds.








Setup a behavior that can accept a limited amount of positions within a world.
These positions would have to always be accessible..

Algorithm should be used to connect a path to run by connecting to nearby unused points and using all points in a goal.
Goals should set exit point if any is set.


Useful data to collect...
entrance: Location after world changes.
distance from the point: This can be used to determine how much we explored on the current point.
waypoint object (if any): As a possible shortcut -- either to skip explored routes or on bot deaths.


Values that should be filled:
How to get to the starting location. -- Waypoint + Any Route or Portals required.
How the points should be explored:
--A set Distance for success

--Custom Kill Radius, Loot Radius, Gizmo Ranges,
	(these would determine the exploration style of the journey..)

--Custom Target Clustering conditions.
	(This would determine speed of journey -- I.E. high values would be quicker)

--Optional entering of Dungeons when discovered.
	This will suspend the current point, and attempt to run and return from the dungeon, before resuming the movement.
	Parameter for exploring dungeons should include # attempts before ending.

--Option to change point
	When distance to a valid point is met -- a new goal using that point as a start should be created and compared.
