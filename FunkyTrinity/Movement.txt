		  /*
  AVOIDANCE
		 -Searching for safe location -- away from all avoidance objects.

  FLEEING
		-Triggered by health of bot and monsters that are closer then desired max distance.


  KITING
		 -Searching for location that should be best suited to execute offense
		 -Ideally Open Location with LOS on multiple engaged units away from any potental flanking packs.
		 -Optionally rotate around outer boundary of cluster to remain within the same area.
		 -Minimum Nearby Units, Minimum Unit Distance, Always on Elites, Allow Agro Locations, 


  GROUPING
		 -Searching for location that should connect the best points for maximum results
		 -Growing groups by finding nearby neighboring clusters and rotating between each to center into a single group.
		 -Behavior should be evaluated for a better grouping setup then the current.
		 -Difference of how behavior is conducted for Melee and Ranged:
			  *Ranged can agro at further distances and remain near the final centering location.
			  *Melee requires close encounters to agro and will require a queued movement plan to group efficently.
					 
		 -Pack Count, Max Distance from bot, Grouping Minimum Units

		 Trigger:
			*Engaging multiple units that are either "tough" and above half hp, 
				-And a group is valid using our specific settings,

			*Engage large groups of weak units if its "on the way"


  ZIGZAG
		 -Searching for location that will hit most units within a given range
