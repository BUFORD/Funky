											 GROUPING
											-Searching for location that should connect the best points for maximum results
											-Growing groups by finding nearby neighboring clusters and rotating between each to center into a single group.
											-Behavior should be evaluated for a better grouping setup then the current.
											-Difference of how behavior is conducted for Melee and Ranged:
												*Ranged can agro at further distances and remain near the final centering location.
												*Melee requires close encounters to agro and will require a queued movement plan to group efficently.
					 
											-Pack Count, Max Distance from bot, Grouping Minimum Units
